Task2: To improve model performance, we can
a) Model centric:
    Adjust the hyperparameters, for example more epochs.
    Or we can change the batch size, hoping to update reasonably.

    Choose a different base model to fine tune with, for example use a larger and newer one.

    Have drop out layers to prevent overfitting.
b) Data centric:
    Perform data augmentation, make some small changes in the sentence to have more variety.

    Standardizing the data, prepare all the data in a standard format and remove irrelevant data.

    Update the data to make them always the newest.
